However, what stirred controversy in the headlines was the content of his lyrics, which some fans believe were a shot directly at his fellow rapper, Travis Scott.</p><p>Rocky said in his set, “another victory be flawless like the skin on me, d*mn/please, please don’t compare him and me, you offendin’ me,” and fans were entirely convinced the ex-boyfriend of Kendall Jenner was referring to Travis Scott.</p><p>The rapper went on to reference in his freestyle the classic line from Denzel Washington in American Gangster, “the loudest ones in the room are always the weakest.” Later on, A$AP took to his social media account to address rumors he was referring to Travis Scott.</p><p>Reportedly, A$AP Rocky isn’t thrilled with the idea of fans and others comparing him to the father of Kylie Jenner’s child, Travis Scott. With that said, Rocky claims there has never been a feud between them. This past year, Peter Rosenberg interviewed A$AP Rocky during a sit-down in which he offered praise for the Astroworld artist.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3mNdVjofxC/</p><p>A$AP Rocky said to reporters that he felt as though he was a pioneer in many respects in the hip-hop community, however, he doesn’t get the respect he deserves, or even the acknowledgment. The star added that he thinks a lot of people can see it as well.</p><p>“I think Travis Scott, he makes cool music,” before going on to say that he had just had a child with Kylie Jenner, adding he was happy for the news. A$AP Rocky has been all over the headlines in the last year, but for less than positive reasons.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>This past summer, the rapper was detained by Swedish authorities for an assault on a 19-year-old man. A$AP and his friends were reportedly followed by irate men, whom they then got into a fight with. A$AP was held for approximately one month while he went through the Swedish legal system.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRlr1uvs6corJlk6GuqrnSZqquqKCkwKawjJucnp5drLa1tIytqZqumah6tK%2FOratmoJGoeq27zaBkn5mUmrFurdaasGahpKh6sbjAspydZZ%2BqwW5%2FkmpncHBf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dog-named-picasso-for-his-twisted-face-is-saved-from-death-at-a-high-kill-shelter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dog named Picasso for his 'twisted face' is saved from death at a high-kill shelter">&larr;
