Alongside his former wife, Martie, he spent countless hours on band practice, performances, and educational excursions. Their compassionate and firm guidance created a joyful and community-focused environment for young musicians to develop their skills.</p><p>Outside of his musical endeavors, Frankie was actively involved in his community. He served as the president of the Tonawanda Exchange Club on two occasions and held the position of president in the WNY National Bicycle Dealers Association. In recognition of his outstanding leadership and dedication, the Tonawanda Chamber of Commerce named him Citizen of the Year in 2000. Frankie’s commitment to his community and his passion for making a difference were truly commendable.</p><h3>Memorial and Donations</h3><p>In honor of Frankie’s memory, the family kindly requests donations to the Community Music School of Buffalo.
