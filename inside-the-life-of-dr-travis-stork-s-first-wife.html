While these days, social media platforms can turn just about anyone into a celebrity, back in the early 2000s, reality television is what did that for people. The reality television show; The Bachelor did that for Travis Lane Stork, making him a household name and making anyone affiliated with the star famous by extension. In this article, Dr. Charlotte Brown was that ‘anyone’. Dr. Charlotte Brown is a medical professional who became popular due to her marriage to and later divorce from a fellow doctor and American television personality; Dr. Travis Lane Stork.</p><p>Profile Summary of Dr. Charlotte Brown</p><ul><li><strong>Name:</strong> Charlotte Brown</li><li><strong>Year of Birth:</strong> 1972</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Nashville, Tennessee</li><li><strong>Parent:</strong> Unknown</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Unknown</li><li><strong>Spouse:</strong> Travis Lane Stork (2012-2015)</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Alma Mater:</strong> Vanderbilt University School of Medicine</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Pediatrician</li></ul><h2><strong>Dr. Charlotte Brown’s Background Details</strong></h2><p>Charlotte Brown was born in Nashville, Tennessee, with no additional information about the specifics of her birth to date, all that is known is that she was born in 1972. Given the fact that Brown generally lives a rather private life, a fact that remained true even while married to Stork, information about her childhood, parents, siblings, or life before college is yet to be brought to light.</p><p>Brown attended a local high school after which she subsequently enrolled in the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine where she went to pursue a degree in pediatrics. After acquiring her degree, she went on to study at the Vanderbilt University Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><h2><strong>Dr. Brown’s Ex-husband Got Popular On The Bachelor</strong></h2><p>Travis Lane Stork, who is best known for his role as the host on the popular television show The Doctors, was born on the 9th of March 1972 to midwestern farmers Roger and Donna Stork in Fort Collins, Colorado. This ex Bachelor attended Parkway West high school after which he enrolled in Duke University where he graduated among the top of his class. Stork also attended the University of Virginia where he got a degree in Medicine.</p><p>Following his graduation from the University of Virginia, Travis pursued a medical residency at the Vanderbilt University Medical Centre where he practiced medicine in the emergency department.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#TheBachelor</a> Season 8 | 9 Januari 2006 | Bachelor: Travis Lane Stork, Winner: Sarah Stone, Proposal: NO <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8X4wTVJflL</a></p><p>— Radio Kampus ITB (@RadioKampusITB) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2015</a></p><p>He made his television debut in 2006 as the star of the eighth season of the Bachelor. At the show’s finale, Stork was matched with a school teacher, Sarah Ston. However, their relationship did not last and the two broke up shortly after the season aired.</p><h2><strong>Dr. Charlotte Brown Married Dr. Stork In 2012</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/dr-travis-stork-dr-charlotte-brown.jpg><p>Dr. Charlotte Brown’s love story with Dr. Stork began in 2010. They met for the first time that year in Hawaii, where they had individually gone on vacation. At this point, Dr. Stork was already a well-known name due to his role as the titular bachelor in the eighth season of “The Bachelor.”</p><p>The two began dating shortly after and had been together for two years before Travis popped the question while they were on the island of Lanai on yet another trip to Hawaii. The couple seemed thrilled all through the period leading to their wedding. Excited Stork continued to tweet about their wedding during that period.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>My days as a "bachelor" are nearing an end! My wedding ring has arrived … getting excited!</p><p>— travisstorkmd (@TravisStorkMD) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 20, 2012</a></p><p>Stork and Brown exchanged vows at a private ceremony in front of a few of their closest friends and family on the 30th of June 2012 on the hills of Colorado.</p><p>During their marriage, the couple led a very private life so it was and still is quite hard to tell what went on behind closed doors, they both seemed happy while in public but it’s not safe to make assumptions based on appearance alone because, in 2015, the couple filed for divorce after just three short years of marriage.</p><p>The couple has remained rather tight-lipped about their reasons for divorce. During the time the two were married, they had no children together. While it does not seem like their marriage ended on a bad note, their paths haven’t seemed to cross since their divorce, a fact that might not be intentional, given that they are both doctors and as such live very busy lives.</p><h2><strong>Did Dr. Charlotte Brown Remarry After Divorcing Travis Stork?</strong></h2><p>Brown became a bit of a public figure after her divorce from Stork, but even with this little fame, she seemed to revert back to her life of privacy before her marriage, and while she most definitely has faded out of the limelight, that fact does not seem to bother the former celebrity wife.</p><p>The good doctor continues with her work as a pediatrician at the Rock Creek Medical Office and currently resides in Boulder, Colorado. She leads a very private life with an almost non-existent social media presence.</p><p>She doesn’t seem to be dating anyone at the moment and even if she was it would be difficult to know due to her aforementioned private life.</p><h3><strong>Her ex-husband Re-married In 2019</strong></h3><p>After the divorce, like Charlotte, Travis seems to have also moved on. He is currently married and content. On the 3rd of August 2019, he married his long-term girlfriend Parris Bell, a lawyer he began a relationship with some time after his divorce from Brown.</p><p>The couple went on vacation to Hawaii and Costa Rica for their honeymoon (Hawaii is indeed a favorite vacation spot for the Dr). The two of them are currently the proud parents of a son, Grayson who was born on the 17th of June 2020.</p><p>Travis Stork also continued hosting his Los Angeles-based daytime talk show, The Doctors which he started hosting in 2008. Before and even during his marriage to Brown, Stork wrote a number of books, he continued to do so after his divorce. He released The Lose Your Belly Diet: Change Your Gut, Change Your Life in 2016, just a little over a year after his divorce.</p><h2><strong>Charlotte Brown Is A Practising Doctor</strong></h2><p>After earning her degree from the Vanderbilt University Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Brown went straight into practicing medicine as a child doctor. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>United States News Health Care</a> reported that she works as a pediatrician at the Rock Creek Medical Office which is in Nashville, Tennessee. According to the same source, her experience and years of practice are now over 10 years.</p><p>Dr. Brown is speculated to have a net worth of between $350,000 and $400,000 which might seem like nothing when compared to her ex-husband’s $8 million net worth but is most definitely nothing to sneeze at.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLGzecKhmKukn6nBpnnBq6awpl2XtrCz0ZqnobFdnru0tcOeZK2glWK5qrLEZqafZZSnerW%2BwK%2BgrGWjqbyzt9JmnaKqo6l6uLXFnmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marie-temara-age-parents-siblings-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marie Temara: Age, Parents, Siblings, Net Worth">&larr;
