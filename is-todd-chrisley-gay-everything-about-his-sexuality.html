The American real estate mogul and reality television personality have been married two times to Teresa Chrisley (first wife) and Julie Chrisley (second wife), and both marriages produced children.</strong></p><p>The creator of Chrisley Knows Best reality show sparked gay rumors several years ago when people started asking questions about his sexuality. The speculations gained wings after his first son, Kyle Chrisley, came open to label him gay, claiming that he has been having an affair with a doctor.</p><h2><strong>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?</strong></h2><p>Father of five, Todd Chrisley isn’t gay, however, there have been doubts about his sexuality, including insinuations from his family that he may be a closeted homosexual.</p><p>The doubt about his sexual orientation was cast by the reality show star and real estate mogul’s first son, Kyle Chrisley, who worked at their family firm, Chrisley Asset Management.</p><p>In November 2014, Kyle revealed to InTouch that his father may be gay and may be sleeping with a medical practitioner whose identity was never revealed.</p><p>Another reason Kyle believed that Todd Chrisley might be gay was his experience during his days at Chrisley Asset Management. According to Kyle, Todd’s response to any of the asset managers that wants to take a pee would be, “’You want me to come hold it for you?”.</p><p>Kyle’s claims set many tongues wagging, but people also stopped to consider the fact that father and son have been having a rocky relationship for years, and the accusations may well be Kyle’s payback.</p><p>We must acknowledge that that wasn’t the first time gay accusations had been leveled at Todd. Many other people have said the same thing, and there was the case of his business colleague who was accused of being his same-sex partner. The colleague was said to be the one who helped in perpetrating tax evasion.</p><h3><strong>Todd Has Denied Every Gay Speculation About Him</strong></h3><p>In 2017, Todd Chrisley came on The Domenick Nati Show to debunk all the homosexual accusations. The American real estate mogul said he is rather flattered that many people think he can actually get laid on both ends, but he is not bothered at all.</p><p>Talking further, Todd also said his wife, Julie Chrisley, is equally flattered that her husband is wanted by both males and females. He concluded his speech by saying that he would never have a drought.</p><p>While Julie Chrisley is yet to break her silence about Todd’s purported gay sexuality, the real estate mogul’s ex-wife has spoken up in his defense. According to what Teresa told Daily Mail in 2014, the gay rumors about Todd Chrisley are totally false; she said she is convinced from her years of marriage to him and the two children they share.</p><h2><strong>When Did Todd Chrisley Get Married?</strong></h2><p>Todd Chrisley has been married twice, his first marriage was to his high school sweetheart, Teresa Chrisley, which lasted from 1990 to 1996.</p><p>Barely a few months after his divorce from Teresa, Todd tied the nuptials for the second time with Julie Chrisley. They wedded on the 25th of May 1996 and have three children to show for their time together as man and wife. Their union has endured for 27 years and still thriving.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Todd Chrisley’s Wife?</strong></h3><p>As earlier mentioned, the name of Todd Chrisley’s wife is Julie Chrisley. Born on the 9th of January 1973, she was called Julie Hughes. Julie comes from Winchester, South Carolina, United States; she achieved her academic qualifications there. The mother of three made it to college, though her course of study is not known.</p><p>Julie announced herself to a wider audience after she became the wife of Todd Chrisley and began recording appearances in his reality show entitled Chrisley Knows Best. However, before her marriage, the South Carolina native was already popular.</p><p>A woman of several hats, Julie is listed as a TV star, social media influencer, cook, media face, realtor, and entrepreneur.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLa0edOom51lk52%2Fqr%2FLnrBmn5GueqbCxKuwraCZo7RurcGorK1lmJ7Abr%2FEsayapJmpxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./king-charles-iii-to-queen-elizabeth-ii.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="King Charles III to Queen Elizabeth II">&larr;
