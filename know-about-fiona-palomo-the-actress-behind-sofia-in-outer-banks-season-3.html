I thought they might have known each other for a very long time, but it turned out that they had just met. But that bond, I’m like, “I’d watch that,” the Nashville star told Entertainment Tonight in February 2023. “Then, when you see how beautifully this show is shot—I don’t know of any other show where more of it happens at sunset. It’s the most golden and beautiful show ever, and the writing is so good that I’m just holding on for dear life and loving every minute of it.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Fiona Palomo is a 24-year-old actress of Mexican descent who plays Sofia in the third season of Outer Banks.
