So who exactly is Angelica Zachary? Angelica, of African and Japanese ancestry, hasn’t been quite as popular in the media as she only came to prominence as the wife of Marlon Wayans. However, the two divorced in 2013 after eight years of marriage, during which time they welcomed two children, Amai Zackary and Shawn Howell, born in 2000 and 2000, respectively. Her birthdate is 26th February, but the exact year is not known, and birthplace also remains unknown to the media for now, as Angelica has remained out of the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/video_image-280598.jpg><h2><span id=Angelica_Zackary_Wiki_Age_Life_Before_Marlon_Wayans>Angelica Zackary Wiki: Age, Life Before Marlon Wayans</span></h2><p>Angelica has been quite secretive about her life prior to meeting Marlon; her age, education, and parents’ names are yet to be revealed. Hopefully, she changes her mind about these things and starts sharing all there is to know with her fans, as they are surely eager to find out more about her.</p><h2><span id=Angelica_and_Marlon_Wayans_Relationship_Marriage_Children_Divorce>Angelica and Marlon Wayans Relationship, Marriage, Children, Divorce</span></h2><p>The couple first met in 2001, and it was that year that they started a romantic relationship, but it took them four years to find out if they were right for each other, and marry in 2005. The couple apparently enjoyed a happy life until the early 2010s, when their romance started fading out, and it was in 2013 that Marlon was seen <a rel=nofollow href=#>kissing some other woman</a>, and the same year the couple announced their divorce, having already started living separately. Nevertheless, despite the divorce, the two have remained on good terms, and have decided on co-parenting their two children, who are now 18 and 16 years old. In February 2018, Marlon shared a birthday message made for his ex-wife, speaking about her with love and respect, and saying that she will always be a part of his <a rel=nofollow href=#>family</a>. Most recently, Marlon created a sitcom based on real-life events, including his life after divorce from Angelica, entitled “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Marlon</a>”. His ex-wife is portrayed by Essence Atkins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newimage.jpg><h2><span id=Angelica_Zachary_Net_Worth>Angelica Zachary Net Worth</span></h2><p>Do you know how rich Angelica Zachary is? Well, Angelica hasn’t revealed much about her profession, in fact, we know nothing of it, however, her wealth is estimated by authoritative sources at over $3 million, thanks largely to the divorce settlement she received once her marriage to Marlon ended.</p><h2><span id=Angelica_Zachary_Ex-Husband_Marlon_Wayans>Angelica Zachary Ex-Husband Marlon Wayans</span></h2><p>Now that we have shared all there is to know about Angelica, let’s share some information about her ex-husband, the famous actor, comedian, and screenwriter, Marlon Wayans.</p><p>Born Marlon Lamont Wayans on the 23rd July 1972, in New York City, USA, he is the youngest of ten children born to Elvira Alethia and Howell Stouten Wayans, all of whom are involved in the entertainment industry as actors, comedians, musicians, and are known as <a rel=nofollow href=#>the Wayans Family</a>. Marlon attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, and after matriculation enrolled at Howard University in Washington, D.C.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Being the youngest in the family, Marlon became the last to become a professional actor; he started with a role in the film “I’m Gonna Git You Sucka” in 1988, and in 1992 joined his brothers in the series “In Living Color”, remaining in the show until 1993, while from 1995 to 1998 he was again with brother Shawn in the series “The Wayans Bros.”. However, it was in the early 2000s that he reached prominence when he and Shawn created the parody film “Scary Movie” in 2000, then “Scary Movie 2”, in 2001, both starring in the films which became classics over the years. His next successful creation was the fantasy comedy film “A Haunted House” in 2013 co-starring next to Essence Atkins, and its sequel “A Haunted House 2” released in 2014, with Marlon and Jaime Pressly starring. In 2016 he wrote the comedy film “Fifty Shades of Black”, a parody on the film “Fifty Shades of Grey”, in which he starred with Kali Hawk, and most recently he started filming “Sextuples” in Netflix production, which will premiere in 2019.</p><h2><span id=Marlon_Wayans_Net_Worth>Marlon Wayans Net Worth</span></h2><p>Being the part of the big Wayans family, it was only natural for Marlon to launch his career in the entertainment industry, but since his first collaboration with his brothers, Marlon has moved away from family and has built a name for himself. So far he has had success with a few projects on his own, including “Marlon”, and “Fifty Shades of Black” among others, contributing steadily to his wealth. So, have you ever wondered how rich Marlon Wayans is, as of late 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Marlon Wayans’ net worth is as high as $40 million. Pretty impressive don’t you think?</p><h2><span id=Marlon_Wayans_Internet_Popularity>Marlon Wayans Internet Popularity</span></h2><p>Marlon is a respected figure on social media platforms, with three million fans on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a>, two million on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitter</a>, and more than 6.5 million on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Facebook</a>, using all to promote his career endeavors, but also share details from his personal life, which you can see if you skip over to his official pages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunCtzaCcpaGTlnq7rcKhmKuxXaKus7jOp2SwmamWu7R5xLFksKGWmnq4tcqiZKShlKh6orPEZpuirp%2BnsKZ5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecGiqa2glJbGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-obama-posts-young-picture-of-barack-obama-on-his-birthday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Obama Posts Young Picture Of Barack Obama On His Birthday">&larr;
