Four months later she was hired as a full time producer for the show. She progressed to camera work, first by giving on-camera archery tips that other hunters were unwilling to, and later by filming and editing many of her own hunts to be aired for free, including a bow hunt of a 202 inch Illinois White-tailed deer. “Nobody turns down free work, I learned,” she says. As a camera professional, she shot, produced, and edited the first season of Mark Kayser’s Extreme Pursuits program.</p><p align=justify>Aaron is her brother.&nbsp;Both her parents were avid hunters.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Melissa Bachman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Melissa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bachman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tv Producer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Minnesota</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dale Bachman, Karen Bachman</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Melissa Bachman ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Stalked inside 60-yards on this beautiful male lion… what a hunt!” to her Twitter and Facebook accounts. The photo quickly drew Internet outrage, including multiple wishes for her death, comedian and animal welfare activist Ricky Gervais re-tweeting Bachman’s message while adding “spot the typo”, and an online petition from a Cape Town resident calling on the South African government to eject her from the country, which gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures. In reaction, Bachman temporarily deactivated her public Facebook and Twitter accounts. Many of the death threats instead went to an unrelated person with a similar name. The Maroi Conservancy, which facilitated the hunt through another outfitter in Zeerust, defended the hunt, stating it was both legal and ethical, and that food and funds from these kinds of hunts go to the struggling local community. International commentators claimed that the online anger directed at Bachman was extraordinary, sexist, and misogynist, and that evidence showed that banning hunting drives species extinct much more than controlled hunts do. At the time of the hunt, African lions were not listed as endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act, though their status was under reassessment and debate.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Melissa Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Producer</strong>.
