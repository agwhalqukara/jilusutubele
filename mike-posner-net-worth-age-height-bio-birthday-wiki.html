He is a singer-songwriter and poet, best known for 31 Minutes to Takeoff. It featured hits such as “Bow Chicka Wow Wow!” and “Cooler Than me.”&nbsp;A remix of his song “I Took a Pill In Ibiza” was his 2016 hit.</p><p>He is friends with&nbsp;He is friends with <a href=#>Big Sean</a>..</p><p>Michael Robert Henrion Posner (/ˈ p oʊ z n ər / POHZ -nər; born February 12, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, poet, and record producer. Posner released his debut album, 31 Minutes to Takeoff, on August 10, 2010. The album includes the US Billboard Hot 100 top 10 single “Cooler than Me” as well as the top 20 single “Please Don’t Go”. In 2016 he released his second album, At Night, Alone. A remix of his 2015 single “I Took a Pill in Ibiza” from the album peaked in the top 10 on the charts in 27 countries around the world, including hitting number one in many and the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. He has written songs for a great number of fellow artists. In March 2017, he released his first book of poetry, Tear Drops & Balloons. Posner is also a member of the alternative hip-hop and R&B duo Mansionz with Matthew Musto (aka blackbear). On April 15, 2019, Posner started to walk across the continental United States, from New Jersey to California. He completed the journey on October 18, 2019 (2851 miles in 186 days), after surviving a rattlesnake bite in August 2019 in Colorado.</p><p>Posner started out as a record producer, working on some tracks with his hometown friend Big Sean. Posner produced and featured on Big Sean’s first mixtape on the song, titled “Yagum”. Posner’s second mixtape, A Matter of Time (the first mixtape being Reflections of a Lost Teen) started attracting industry attention in 2009. Working with Don Cannon and DJ Benzi, the mixtape was recorded at Duke University in March 2009 under the name, “Mike Posner & the Brain Trust”, the Brain Trust referring to Posner’s supporters. The release was unusual for being distributed for free through iTunes U, a channel designed for educational audio content. Although Posner was not the only artist to take advantage of this loophole, his release was the most organized and high profile, and attracted the largest response, immediately reaching the number one position on the iTunes U chart. Posner signed a record deal with J Records (RCA/Sony) in July 2009, after his Junior year at Duke University. He chose to return to Duke after signing, and toured on the weekends while at the same time recording for his debut album.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Detroit, Michigan.&nbsp;Roberta Henrion was his mother and Jon Posner was his father.&nbsp;He has an older brother.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Posner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Posner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1988</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Detroit</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jon Posner, Roberta Henrion</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Posner ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Running seven dates in the major US markets, the tour highlighted music new and old from Posner’s discography, including some new material from Pages, while also giving fans a shot at learning new information from him through the stories and Q&A sessions interspersed with the tunes. The unplugged sets featured little more than Posner on predominantly acoustic instruments, save for the potential live production on “a song or two”—much like, he says, how much of his music starts. Posner began the tour on March 31 at the World Cafe in Philadelphia, wrapping up on April 10 at Los Angeles’ The Mint. The string of dates also included a hometown show in Posner’s native Detroit, his first such show, he says, in around two years.
