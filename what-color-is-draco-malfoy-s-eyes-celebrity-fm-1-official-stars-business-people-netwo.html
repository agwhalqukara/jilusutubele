Bonnie Wright who played Ginny in the movies had blue eyes, so that’s where the confusion comes from.</p><p>Is Hermione the smartest witch? In the Harry Potter series, Hermione is seen as one of the smartest characters in the books. Given her age, she’s often talked about as the <b>smartest witch</b> in her grade and viewed as being much smarter than her peers. … Hermione was great at things like logic and many kinds of magic, and she also was extremely studious.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_color_are_Luna_Lovegood%E2%80%99s_eyes></span>What color are Luna Lovegood’s eyes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A <b>pale gray</b>, giving her eyes that distinctly silvery hue.</p><p>Also Why are Daniel Radcliffe’s eyes always red? As Digital Spy reports, producer David Heyman recently explained in an interview for Empire that Radcliffe’s <b>green contact lenses caused an allergic reaction</b> that made his eyes “puffy and red,” which was “quite appropriate for the scene.” It was only the first day of filming, and the allergic reaction was problematic …</p><p>Why do Voldemort’s eyes turn red? Short answer is <b>because he is evil</b>. He had red eyes ever since he was a teenager. Whenever he was particularly evil, his eyes flashed scarlet. It is possible this is a side effect of creating Horcruxes, as we only see the red eyes past the time Riddle made his first Horcrux.</p><p>What colour are Dumbledore’s eyes? Dumbledore’s <b>blue eyes</b> show us the immense tranquility and wisdom of the headmaster. The color has some highly magical abilities such as the gift of invigorating body and soul and the ability to calm, depending on the current need.

Watson <b>reportedly has an IQ of 138</b>. This means she is categorized in the moderately gifted box but falls short of the highly gifted box by seven points.

The general consensus is that Harry Potter’s favorite color is <b>red</b>.</p><p>Is Luna Lovegood related to Draco? They may be related, but that would have to be very distantly. Luna’s father is Xenophilius Lovegood, and her mother died in front of her when she was nine. Draco’s father is Lucius Malfoy, and his mother is Narcissa Malfoy, née Black. So even if they’re related, they <b>most definitely are not siblings</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Emma_Watson_have_kids></span>Does Emma Watson have kids?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Emma Watson Family Members, Affairs & More</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Father Name</th><th>Chris Watson</th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend / Affairs</td><td>William Knight</td></tr><tr><td>Husband / Spouse</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Son Name</td><td>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p>• Jun 1, 2021</p><p>Why didn’t they make Daniel Radcliffe’s eyes green? 9. His eyes were a different color in the movie because Daniel Radcliffe couldn’t wear contacts. … “The only really important thing is that <b>his eyes look like his mother’s eyes</b>,” she said. “So if you’re casting Lily, there needs to be a resemblance, but they don’t absolutely have to be green.”</p><p>Is Daniel Radcliffe in cursed child?</p><p>Despite Columbus thinking it would be fantastic for Radcliffe to star in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, he is not in the stage production. In fact, <b>he has never seen the play.</b></p><p>Why didn’t the movies give Voldemort red eyes? Specifically, at 1:56, David Heyman and Mike Newell explain that <b>they felt the red eyes would remove too much humanity from Voldemort</b>. David Heyman says that while the red eyes were a successful image in the book, that in the film the red eyes would rob Ralph Fiennes of a lot of expression and make the character bland.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Voldemort_actor></span>Who is Voldemort actor?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Ralph Fiennes</b> portrays Voldemort from Goblet of Fire to Deathly Hallows Part 2.</p><p>Why are Voldemort’s eyes blue? As for Voldemort, it’s said that whoever designed him thought red eyes would make him feel less real. Like a cartoon villain, you know.
