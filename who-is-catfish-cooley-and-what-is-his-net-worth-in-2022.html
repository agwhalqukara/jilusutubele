His nationality is American while his ethnicity is Caucasian. His father is a construction worker/foreman named Charles Cooley. His parents divorced at some point and his dad later remarried. The name of his stepmother is Lawanda Cooley.</p><p>Catfish Cooley’s real name is David Allen Cooley. He got the moniker, Catfish, from his gym pals. He was a gym rat while growing up and often worked out. During his workouts, his friends believed that he made a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">sound</a> reminiscent of a Catfish. They therfore started calling him that and it stuck.</p><h2><strong>He Got Famous for His Drunken Motivational Facebook Videos in the Early 2010s</strong></h2><p>Catfish Cooley grew up in Pitkin, Louisiana, and had a typical southern upbringing complete with the mannerism and the accent. He completed at least a high school diploma before going on to work in a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">mill</a>. This helped him to make a steady income and he lived a normal life for some time. Cooley initially used his Facebook page for just random posts. However, in the early 2010s, he started using his Facebook page to share videos on his whiskey Wednesdays.</p><p>His videos were motivational in nature but he took it up a notch by being rip-roaring drunk in the course of each video. The clip of a drunken person dishing out motivational advice made for very hilarious content and Cooley soon amassed thousands of followers on his channel. He then became even more famous when he was invited to the Comedy Central Show, Tosh.0, for an interview in 2015.</p><p>He brought his redneck persona in all its full glory and the result was a hilarious video that attracted millions of views. This introduced him to new audiences and made him even more popular.</p><h2><strong>The Entertainer Joined YouTube in 2017 and is now a Popular Personality on the Platform</strong></h2><p>Catfish Cooley joined YouTube in March 2017 and continued his whiskey Wednesday shows there. He also incorporated pranks as well. The Pitkin native also fully exploited his redneck background for comic relief and this won him so many fans. Such massive followership continues to this very day.</p><p>The content creator now has 298k subscribers on his YouTube account and his content has been viewed more than 24 million times. One of his very popular subgenres is the hot sauce genre. He often challenges himself to eat the hottest chocolate sauce or the hottest noodle sauce in the world. His attempts to do this often lead to hilarious results with him coughing, sneezing, and vomiting food.</p><h2><strong>He is also a Stand-Up Comedian and Budding Musician</strong></h2><p>Catfish Cooley is not just a popular internet personality but also a bona fide standup comedian. He is affiliated with the Nitro Comedy Tour and has performed all over America from 2018 to date. Some of his stops include Miami, Iowa, and Boston Ohio. Cooley has also performed in countries such as Canada. His comedy is generally accepted by all and this is because he keeps things real and simple. He tells relatable stories about life and avoids combustible topics such as politics and religion.</p><p>In addition to being a comedian, Catfish Cooley is also a budding musician. He collaborated with Big Murphy for the release of their debut album, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Milf and Cookies</a> in 2022. The ten-track album featured songs such as Clean, Paranoia, Miss Me, Nasty, Turn Up, and Country Boy. It was immediately lapped up by his fans and made it to No. 3 on Amazon and No. 5 on iTunes. Of course, the streams that pushed it to such numbers also translate into revenue for Catfish Cooley.</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>Catfish Cooley’s Net Worth Stands At $8 Million</strong></h2><p>Catfish Cooley is now worth an estimated $8 million and a good part of it comes from his YouTube earnings. The YouTube revenue/payment algorithm is a very complicated one but it is believed that on average, creators make <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">$5-7</a> per 1,000 views.</p><p>Catfish Cooley’s content has been viewed 24,402, 694 times and counting. It, therefore, means he has made from $122,013 to $170,818 on YouTube. These are very conservative estimates though and it is possible that he has earned higher.</p><p>Another lucrative source of income for Catfish Cooley is his comedy tours with Nitro Comedy Tour. He has been to several cities in America to perform stand-up. He has also performed in other countries such as Canada.</p><p>His total earnings from these performances are not known but it would be reasonable to assume that it runs into six figures given the ticket prices involved. The ticket price for the Nitro Comedy show in Jordan, New York, in 2018 was $21 while fans who wanted a meet and greet had to shell out an additional $20. These prices would have definitely risen over the years enhancing Cooley’s earnings.</p><p>With such a cool stage name, one would expect Catfish Cooley to delve into the merchandise industry and this is the reality. The comedian launched his official merchandise store in April 2017 and it remains in business to date.</p><p>They have branded t-shirts with words such as Catfish Cooley and Whiskey Wednesdays. They also carry other items such as bumper stickers. It is hard to tell Catfish Cooley’s exact income from his merchandise store but it should also be impressive given that fans are often yearning for them on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/Catfish-Cooley.jpg><h3><strong>Catfish Cooley’s Net Worth Compared to Ginger Billy</strong></h3><p>Ginger Billy is a fast-rising comedian and YouTube star.
